# Web Scraping: Real Estate Modeling 🏡
This project focuses on web scraping real estate listings from Craigslist Toronto (Real Estate Section), using HTML-based scraping techniques (JavaScript rendering is not included).

After extracting the data, I cleaned and structured it into a well-formatted CSV file, which was then transformed into a clean Pandas DataFrame.

The cleaned dataset was later used to generate a visual report and analysis using Tableau.
